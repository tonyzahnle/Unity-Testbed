Unity-Testbed
=============

Various tests and experiments within Unity
Also partially a personal learning tool for using Github/SourceTree!

Current scripts:
+Logger.cs - No implementation currently, but hoping to expand to a grand upgraded logging tool to use within Unity games to investigate crashes.
+AudioAnalyzer.cs - Experimenting with Unity's AudioClip structure and seeing what kind of data can be extracted to use within potential future projects.
+DebugManager.cs - Early first pass at creating a debug button with Unity's OnGUI system to change various values within a game.
